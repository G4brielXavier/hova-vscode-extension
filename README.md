# Hova Extension — A VsCode Extension for Hova DSL

![HOVA](./gifs/HOVA.png)

**Hova** is a declarative DSL designed for structured worldbuilding, configuration and semantic data modelings. It allows you to describe systems, entities and concepts in a human-readable, expressive and symbolic way, while still being strict enough to generate predictable structured outputs such as JSON or schema-like data.

This VSCode extension adds syntax hightlighting, hover information and tooling support to make working with **Hova** easier, clearer and more powerful.
